=======

This is intended a light weight Sparse Grid implementation focused mostly on density estimation. This is a WIP and this readme will be filled with up to date comments about the process.

20/06/14: I have finished a major reorganization of the code. Unfortunately things are probably a little slower and less general now, but hopefully it is more readable, and will be easier to extend to the point I need. 

New build instructions.

19/06/14: I have made the following design choices for now
		  
- **C++11** : For the time being the library will be written for C++11. The reason to use C++ is so that I 
		  	have access to both Eigen (a C++ template library for linear algebra) and std library containers. The
		  	reason to use C++11 is that this allows me to use shared_ptr without requiring boost. Eventually if it
		  	seems feasible I will try and copy in my own implementation of the required elements to try and move 
		  	closer to C.
		  
- **RegularGrid**: I have decided that I will first focus on getting algoirthms working for the regular grid,
		    then for the combination grid, then finally for a full SparseGrid. This may make a regular Sparse Grid
		    difficult to implement if it becomes needed, but there are other libraries for this, and starting from
		    that point seems top heavy when I hope for this to be a light weight implementation
		  
- **Avoiding Recursion**: I have decided to try and avoid recursion in algorithms where possible. I do not 
		    have a good reason for this, other than that it might be faster, and seems like a fun thing to try...


**Comments**: I appreciate any comments on the current state of the code, but do keep in mind two things:
1) This is a WIP, and 2) this is as much a project to learn as anything else.

Install
-------
20/06/14: calling 'make' should build the libraries and install a python module (generated by swig) called 'sparsepad'. There are some minor problems with inpt and output right now, but will add a demo example tomorrow.
